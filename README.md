# Book Recommendation App

## General Description
This app uses the [TasteDive API](https://tastedive.com/) to provide book recommendations to the user based on provided artistic inputs that can be drawn not just from books, but also music, TV, and movies. The user will get a list of recommendations along with direct links to searches for those author and book recommendations on both Indiebound (if the user wants to buy from a local book store) and Alibris (if the user wants to look for used copies).
