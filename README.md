# Book Recommendation App

## General Description
This app uses the [TasteDive API](https://tastedive.com/) to provide book recommendations to the user based on provided artistic inputs that can be drawn not just from books, but also music, TV, and movies. The user will get a list of recommendations with links to corresponding Wikipedia entries and New York Times reviews (called using the [NYTimes Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview)) to help the user determine if an author/book is of interest to them. If they decide "yes", they will be able to click to reveal direct links to searches for those author and book recommendations on both [Indiebound](https://www.indiebound.org/) (if the user wants to buy from a local book store) and [Alibris](https://www.alibris.com/) (if the user wants to look for used copies). Finally, there will be an optional window inviting users to input the ISBNs of any specific books they're interested in, which will allow them to check whether the book is available for free through [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/), which will involve use of the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books).
